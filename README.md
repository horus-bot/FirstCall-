# 🚑 FirstCall - AI-Powered Emergency Dispatch System

**FirstCall** is a centralized, AI-driven ambulance dispatch system designed to optimize emergency response in real-time by factoring in **traffic congestion**, **hospital capacity**, **doctor availability**, and **ambulance readiness**. It intelligently allocates the most suitable ambulance and hospital based on patient severity and real-world constraints.

npx expo start


📈 Market Scope
Emergency response times in urban India are severely hampered by poor traffic routing and disconnected hospital systems. FirstCall is built for smart cities and next-gen healthcare infrastructure, allowing governments and private institutions to cut response times drastically while optimizing hospital load management.

🔮 Future Scope
🌍 Integration with Google Maps / Mapbox for route optimization

🧠 AI-powered severity prediction based on video/image input

📡 IoT-based real-time ambulance + traffic sensors

🧬 Predictive modeling for epidemic surges & load balancing

🗣️ Multilingual support for regional emergency calls

🕶️ AR-based infrastructure simulation tools
